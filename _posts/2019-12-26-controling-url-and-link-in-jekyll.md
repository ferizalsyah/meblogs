Jekyll is a static-site generator that provides some of the benefits of a Content Management System (CMS) while avoiding the performance and security issues introduced by such database-driven sites. It is “blog-aware” with special features to handle date-organized content, although its usefulness is not limited to blogging sites. Jekyll is well-suited for people who need to work off-line, who prefer to use a lightweight editor instead of web forms for maintaining content, and who wish to use version control to track changes to their website.

In this tutorial, we’ll focus on how Jekyll handles URLs and linking since changing URLs will break other people’s link to our pages, as well as links in the content of our own site. URLs are critical to how people find and use websites and warrant consideration before publishing a site for the first time.

We’ll look at how Jekyll creates URLs by default and show how to change the pattern for an individual file or the entire site. Then we’ll look a how to link to pages within our content. Finally, we’ll stage the site for testing.
