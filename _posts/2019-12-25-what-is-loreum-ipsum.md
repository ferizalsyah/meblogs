If you were to secure your site with SSL, you should not request any data from a http server. Everything should be https! But, most of the ads on Adsense are from a http source which is not acceptable for an SSL certified website.

Google detects whether your website has an SSL certificate or not and serves ads accordingly. If you activate SSL in your website, Google will filter only https ads and serve it. This way you may miss some high paying ads.
